# Tracy 3D Engine

## What is Tracy?

Tracy is a simple open-source 3D engine which has been 
written fully in C++. Its understandable code is incredibly 
useful for learning purposes. Tracy uses bitmap files as 
its output in order to reduce platform specific codes.

## Compile and run

You should have GNU C++ Compiler installed on your system,
then simply `make` and run `./tracy`!
Path of output file is: `./files/output.bmp`
You can change the scene by modifying `main.cpp`
